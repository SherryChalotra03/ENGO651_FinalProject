# Technical Report: Risk-Aware Route Planning in Calgary Using Accident Data

**Date:** March 26, 2025  
**Objective:** Develop a risk-aware route planning system for Calgary, Alberta, using a 5-year dataset of accident locations, incorporating clustering/hotspot analysis, a risk layer for road segments, and A* routing with dynamic temporal adjustments.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

The goal was to create a route planning system that minimizes exposure to accident-prone areas in Calgary, leveraging a dataset of accident locations spanning the last 5 years. The system needed to:
- Identify high-risk zones using clustering or hotspot analysis.
- Assign risk scores to road segments based on proximity to these zones.
- Perform route planning with the A* algorithm, balancing distance and risk, while dynamically adjusting risk based on rush hour, day of the week, and month of the year.

This required integrating spatial analysis, graph-based routing, and temporal risk modulation into a cohesive solution.

## 2. Methodology

The solution was developed in three main phases, each building on the previous:

### 2.1. Identifying High-Risk Zones
**Objective:** Detect accident clusters or hotspots to inform risk scoring.  
**Approach:**
- **Clustering (DBSCAN):** Grouped accident locations based on spatial proximity.
- **Hotspot Analysis (Getis-Ord Gi*):** Validated clusters by identifying statistically significant concentrations of accidents.

**Steps:**
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Loaded accident data (latitude, longitude, optional severity) into a GeoDataFrame, ensuring a consistent CRS (e.g., WGS84).
2. **DBSCAN Clustering:** Applied Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to identify natural groupings, using parameters like `eps=200m` (distance threshold) and `min_samples=5`.
3. **Getis-Ord Gi* Analysis:** Computed z-scores and p-values to detect hotspots, using a distance-based spatial weights matrix (threshold=200m), implemented with `PySAL/esda`.

**Outcome:** A set of accident clusters and statistically significant hotspots, providing a foundation for risk assessment.

---

### 2.2. Building a Risk Layer
**Objective:** Assign risk scores to road segments based on proximity to clusters/hotspots.  
**Approach:** Used inverse distance weighting to quantify risk, integrating spatial data into a road network graph.

**Steps:**
1. **Road Network Acquisition:** Retrieved Calgary’s drivable road network from OpenStreetMap using `osmnx`, projected to UTM (e.g., EPSG:32612) for accurate distance calculations.
2. **Risk Score Calculation:** Developed a function (`calculate_road_risk`) to:
   - Input: Road segment geometry (`road_gdf`), hotspot GeoDataFrame (`hotspot_gdf`), `max_distance=500m`, `power=2`.
   - Process: Computed distances from each road segment’s centroid to nearby hotspots, applied inverse distance weighting (1/d²), and capped scores at `max_risk=1.0`.
3. **Graph Integration:** Assigned risk scores as edge attributes in a `networkx` graph, preserving original attributes like length and geometry.

**Outcome:** A road network graph with each edge annotated with a `risk_score`, reflecting proximity to accident hotspots.

---

### 2.3. Route Planning with A* and Dynamic Adjustments
**Objective:** Compute optimal routes balancing distance and risk, with temporal adjustments for rush hour, weekdays, and winter months.  
**Approach:** Implemented the A* algorithm with a custom cost function, dynamically scaling risk based on time.

**Steps:**
1. **Graph Construction:** Converted a shapefile of routes (with precomputed `risk_score`) into a `networkx` DiGraph, inferring nodes from LineString endpoints if not provided.
2. **Dynamic Risk Adjustment:** Created `adjust_risk_score` to:
   - Increase risk by `rush_hour_factor=2.0` during 7–9 AM and 4–6 PM.
   - Apply `weekday_factor=1.5` for Monday–Friday.
   - Use `winter_factor=1.5` for December–February.
   - Cap adjusted risk at 1.0.
3. **A* Implementation:** Developed `astar_path` with:
   - **Heuristic:** Euclidean distance between nodes.
   - **Cost Function:** `alpha * length + beta * adjusted_risk * length`, where `alpha=1.0` (distance weight) and `beta=2.0` (risk weight).
   - Inputs: Start/end nodes, current time.
4. **Route Extraction:** Mapped the A* path back to a GeoDataFrame for visualization and computed total distance and risk.

**Outcome:** A route planning system that generates paths avoiding high-risk areas, with risk sensitivity varying by time of day, week, and year.

```

#### Risk Layer Construction
```python
def calculate_road_risk(road_geometry, hotspot_gdf, max_distance=500, power=2):
    centroid = road_geometry.centroid
    distances = hotspot_gdf.geometry.distance(centroid)
    risk_score = sum(1 / (dist ** power) for dist in distances[distances <= max_distance] if dist > 0)
    return min(risk_score, 1.0)
road_gdf["risk_score"] = road_gdf["geometry"].apply(lambda g: calculate_road_risk(g, hotspot_gdf))
```

    def cost(u, v, d):
        length = G[u][v][d]["length"]
        adjusted_risk = adjust_risk_score(G[u][v][d]["risk_score"], current_time)
        return alpha * length + beta * adjusted_risk * length

## 4. Results and Validation

### 4.1. Hotspot Analysis
- DBSCAN identified clusters of varying sizes, validated by Gi* hotspots (z > 1.96, p < 0.05).
- Hotspots aligned with expected high-risk areas (e.g., busy intersections), confirming statistical significance.

### 4.2. Risk Layer
- Risk scores ranged from 0 to 1, with higher values near hotspots (e.g., within 500m).
- Distribution: Mean ~0.2, max 1.0 (capped), reflecting localized risk concentration.

### 4.3. Route Planning
- **Test Case:** Downtown to West Calgary, March 26, 2025, 5 PM (rush hour).
  - Path length: ~10–15 km (depending on network).
  - Total risk: Increased by 2x during rush hour, moderated by `beta=2.0`.
- Routes avoided high-risk segments during rush hour, weekdays, and winter, shifting to safer alternatives.

### 4.4. Visualization
- Maps showed hotspots, risk-colored road segments (red=high, green=low), and computed routes, aligning with intuitive safety expectations.
